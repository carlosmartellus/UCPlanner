# UCPlanner

## Version
**0.0.1**

## Libraries
- `setuptools`: tested with version `80.9.0` (should work with `>=64`).
- `PySide6`: tested with version `6.9.1`, might or might not work with other versions.
- `SQLAlchemy`: tested with version `2.0.43`, might or might not work with other versions.
- `pytest`: Optional but useful for testing. Tested with version `8.4.1`

## Considerations
It is made in base of Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile 's system so this won't work as Canvas or other typical planner. If you want to use this code for your own planner, modify `db/models` and `db/controllers`

Since university has not provided a database, in this version courses must be registered manually.
