# UCPlanner

## Version
**0.0.1**

## Libraries
- `setuptools`: tested with version `80.9.0` (should work with `>=64`).
- `PySide6`: tested with version `6.9.1`, might or might not work with other versions.
- `SQLAlchemy`: tested with version `2.0.43`, might or might not work with other versions.

## Considerations
Since university has not provided a database, in this version courses must be registered manually.
